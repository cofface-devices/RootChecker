RootChecker
=========================

RootChecker is a sample Android app that can detect if a device is rooted or not.
It is heavily influenced by code/comments found in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1101380/determine-if-running-on-a-rooted-device
After mashing up everything found in the aforementioned post and modifyingt for the needs of my apps, I thought I should share :) 
No special dependencies and extra libraries required. The project was build under latest (at the time 1.4) version of Android Studio.
